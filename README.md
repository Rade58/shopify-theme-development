# FOR LOOPS AND SOME OTHER LIQUID THINGS

**WHEN "STORE MANAGER" (I CALLED IT LIKE THIS), STORE OWNER, ANYONE WHO HAS ACCESS TO THE DASBOARD OF THE STORE, ANYONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO OPERATE DASBOARD, DECIDES TO ADD SOMETHING, SOME INFO, IN INTENTION TO ADD DATA TO THE PART OF THE WEBSITE; WE WANT THAT TO REFLECT ON THE UI OF THE STORE, WE WANT THAT DATA TO BE RENDERED**

IDEA IS THAT HE ADS DATA AND WE AS A DEVELOPERS IN A THEME DEFINE DISPLAYING THAT DATA

**ONE OF THE EXAMPLES FOR THIS IS NAVIGATION**

## GO TO DASBOARD OF YOUR STORE AND IN LEFT MENU FOR (Online Store) YOU CAN FIND `Navigation`

YOU CAN SEE **Menus**

I HAVE TWO MENUS: Main (WITH ITEMS Home, Catalog, Contact), AND Footer (WITH ITEMS Search)

YOU CAN CLICK ON Main OR Footer AND ADD OR REMOVE ITEMS FOR THESE NAVIGATION ELEMENTS

I AM GOING TO ADD NEW MENU, I CALLLED IT Products AND I ADDED ITEM THAT IS BASICALLY NAVIGATION THAT LEADS TO PAGE OF AALL PRODUCTS (JUST TO SHOW YOU THAT YOU CAN DO THIS)

**LETS ADD SOME NAVIGATION ITEMS TO THE MENU, THAT WAS HERE EARLIER**

FOR EXAMPLE LETS ADD NAVIGATION OF THE SINGLE PRODUCT (YOU CAN MAR IT "Product of the day" OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, WHAT EVER YOU THINK OF`)

## OK NOW YOU CAN START YOUR STORE, T OSEE IF YOU HAVE ANY CHANGIS IN ANIMATION SEGMENT
