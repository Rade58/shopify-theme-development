# SHOPIFY CLI

IT IS GOOD FOR US TO DO SOME THINGS FIRST

# FIRST WE WANT TO DUPLICATE OUR THEME, BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO EDIT CURRENT PUBLISHED THEME

IN DASBORD CLICK ON ACTIONS AND DUPLICATE THEME, WHEN THAT IS DONE, YOU CAN RENAME A COPY, BY GIVING IT SOME NAME YOU THINK OF TO "MARK IT" AS A DEVELOPMENT THEME

I RENAMED BOTH THEMES

THE CURRENTLY DEPLOYD I GAVE A NAME: `fancy-parrot-theme`, AND I NAMD A COPY AS `fancy-parrot-theme-dev`

**WE CAN SAY THAT WE ARE GOING TO USE COPY FOR DEVELOPING AND FOR STAGING**

## WE CAN PREVIEW THE THEME WE COPIED

IT WILL BE THE SAM URL AS PUBLISHED THEME (URL OF PUBLISHED STORE)

BUT YOU WILL HAVE SOME EXTRA STUFF AS A UERY STRING IN ADRESS BAR, ALSO YOU WILL HAVE A BOTTOM BAR TELLING YOU WHAT THEME WE ARE PREVIEEWING

YOU CAN SHARE THIS PREVIEW LIKE YOU SEE, YOU HAVE A BUTTON TO COPY A LINK

AGAIN, WE HAVE GENERATED PASSWORD AND ANYONE HO WOULD LIIKE TO SEE IT NEEDS TO ENTER THE PASSWORD (ALREADY I EXPLAIN YOU THAT)
