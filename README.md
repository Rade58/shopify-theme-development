# USING AND INSTALLING CSS FRAMEWORK

WE CAN USE TAILWIND (I SAW COUPLE TUTORIALS THAT SHOW YOU HOW)

BUT WE ARE GOING TO USE BOOTSTRAP

## WHEN SETTING THIS WE ARE LOOKING INTO `/assets` FOLDER

IT'S A FOLDER FOR EVERYTHING: **FOR CSS, FOR JAVASCRIPT AND FOR IMAGES**

NOW WE ARE INTERESTED IN CSS

## WE WILL DOWNLOAD BOOTSTRAP

**OTHER ALTERNATIVE IS USING CDN** (WE WON'T BE DOING THAT)

[DOWNLOAD IT](https://getbootstrap.com/)

EXTRACTIT

COPY MINIFIED VERSION OF CSS AND JAVASCRIPT AND PUT THEM IN `/assets` FOLDER (TOGETHER WITH MAP FILES)

```
mkdir assets/bootstrap
```

I ADDED THIS

```
ls assets/bootstrap
```

```zsh
bootstrap.min.css  bootstrap.min.css.map  bootstrap.min.js  bootstrap.min.js.map
```

## LINK THIS FILES BY EDITING `layout/theme.liquid`

**FOR THE FIRST TIME WE WILL BE WRITTING LIQUID SPECIFIC SYNTAX**

WE ARE GOING TO USE `asset_url` FILTER FOR THE FIRT TIME

IT SHOULD BE SELF EXPLANATORY IF YOU TAKE IN MIND THAT LIQUID IS TEMPLATING LANGUAGE AND THAT WE ARE TEMPLATING; **THERE FOR I WONT BE EXPLAINING IT TOO MUCH SINCE YOU HAVE DOCUMENTATION**

[SEE HERE](https://shopify.dev/api/liquid/filters/url-filters)

IN head SECTION I THREW THIS

- `code layout/theme.liquid`

```liquid

```
