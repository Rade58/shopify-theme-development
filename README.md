# THEME KITIS THE OLD WAY OF BUILDING THEMES

## BEFORE WE START JUST TO TELL YOU THAT YOU CAN SEE CODE OR EDIT CODE DIRECTLY FROM DASBORD OF YOUR THEME BY CLICKING ON `Actions` BUTTON

I CAN SEE BUNCH OF FILES, SOME OF THEM ARE LIQUID, AND SOME OF THEM ARE JSON

THIS IS A BIT CONFUSING TO ME SINCE I HEARD THAT YOU "DEVELOP WITH LIQUID OR JSON"

## THEME KIT VS SHOPIFY CLI

THERE ARE TWO APPROACHES

BUILDING THEME WITH **THEME KIT AND LIQUID TEMPLATE LANGUAGE**

AND `MODERN WAY` (2021 YEAR) IS BUILDING THEME WITH **SHOPIFY CLI AND JSON TAMPLATES** (AND I GUESS THAT WITH THIS APPROACH, YOU STILL CAN USE LIQUID, I'M GESSING THIS BECAUSE I'M LOOKING AT CODE OF SOME SAMPLE SHOPIFY THEME, AND I SEE BOTH THINGS INSIDE, LIGUID AND JSON)

**WE WILL LEARN BOTH WAYS, WE WILL USE THEME KIT, AND AFTER WE DO THAT WE WILL LEARN ABOUT JSON TEMPLATES**

BUT FIRST WE ARE GOING TO LEARN THEME KIT APPROACH

***

THERE IS ONE MORE IMPORTANT THING

`IF YOU CHOOSE TO USE JSON TEMPLATES, YOU CAN'T USE THEME KIT`

***
***

## WE ARE GOING TO LEARN THEME KIT APPROACH BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW HOW TO MAYBE CUSTOMIZE SOME OLDER THEME THAT IS EXISTING FOR THE LONG TIME AND MERCHANT WANTS TO CHANGE SOMETHING

I GUESS THAT WOULD BE PROBABLE SCENARIO

# FIRST WE NEED TO DUPLICATE OUR THEME, BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO EDIT CURRENT PUBLISHED THEME

IN DASBORD CLICK ON ACTIONS AND DUPLICATE THEME, WHEN THAT IS DONE, YOU CAN RENAME A COPY, BY GIVING IT SOME NAME YOU THINK OF TO "MARK IT" AS A DEVELOPMENT THEME

I RENAMED BOTH THEMES

THE CURRENTLY DEPLOYD I GAVE A NAME: `fancy-parrot-theme`, AND I NAMD A COPY AS `fancy-parrot-theme-dev`

**WE CAN SAY THAT WE ARE GOING TO USE COPY FOR DEVELOPING AND FOR STAGING**

## WE CAN PREVIEW THE THEME WE COPIED

IT WILL BE THE SAM URL AS PUBLISHED THEME (URL OF PUBLISHED STORE)

BUT YOU WILL HAVE SOME EXTRA STUFF AS A UERY STRING IN ADRESS BAR, ALSO YOU WILL HAVE A BOTTOM BAR TELLING YOU WHAT THEME WE ARE PREVIEEWING

YOU CAN SHARE THIS PREVIEW LIKE YOU SEE, YOU HAVE A BUTTON TO COPY A LINK

AGAIN, WE HAVE GENERATED PASSWORD AND ANYONE HO WOULD LIIKE TO SEE IT NEEDS TO ENTER THE PASSWORD (ALREADY I EXPLAIN YOU THT)

## WE WILL INSTALL THEME KIT NOW
