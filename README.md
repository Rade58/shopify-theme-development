# THEME KITIS THE OLD WAY OF BUILDING THEMES

## BEFORE WE START JUST TO TELL YOU THAT YOU CAN SEE CODE OR EDIT CODE DIRECTLY FROM DASBORD OF YOUR THEME BY CLICKING ON `Actions` BUTTON

I CAN SEE BUNCH OF FILES IN OUR THEME, SOME OF THEM ARE LIQUID, AND SOME OF THEM ARE JSON

I WOULD SAY MOST OF THEM ARE JSON

THIS IS A BIT CONFUSING TO ME SINCE I HEARD THAT YOU "DEVELOP WITH LIQUID OR JSON"

BUT MAJOR FILES FOR THE PAGES ARE JSON, I HAVE FOR EXAMPLE `index.json`, `collection.json`

YOU HAVE SOME LIQUID FILES

## THEME KIT VS SHOPIFY CLI

THERE ARE TWO APPROACHES IN BUILDING THEME

BUILDING THEME WITH **THEME KIT AND LIQUID TEMPLATE LANGUAGE**

AND `MODERN WAY` (2021 YEAR) IS BUILDING THEME WITH **SHOPIFY CLI AND JSON TAMPLATES** (AND I GUESS THAT WITH THIS APPROACH, YOU STILL CAN USE LIQUID, I'M GESSING THIS BECAUSE I'M LOOKING AT CODE OF OURY THEME, AND I SEE BOTH THINGS INSIDE, LIGUID AND JSON, BUT MOST OF THE FILES ARE JSON)

***

THERE IS ONE MORE IMPORTANT THING

`IF YOU CHOOSE TO USE JSON TEMPLATES, YOU CAN'T USE THEME KIT`

***

AND THIS IS WHAT SHOPIFY SAYS:

>> [Shopify CLI replaces Theme Kit for most Shopify theme development tasks. You should use Shopify CLI if you're working on Online Store 2.0 themes. You should use Theme Kit instead of Shopify CLI only if you're working on older themes or you have Theme Kit integrated into your existing theme development workflows.](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/theme-kit)

## WE ARE GOING TO LEARN THEME KIT APPROACH BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW HOW TO MAYBE CUSTOMIZE SOME OLDER THEME THAT IS EXISTING FOR THE LONG TIME AND MERCHANT WANTS TO CHANGE SOMETHING

I GUESS THAT WOULD BE PROBABLE SCENARIO

## WE WILL INSTALL THEME KIT NOW

WE CAN FOLLOW THIS TO INSTALL IT

<https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/theme-kit/getting-started>

BUT I JUST COULDN'T INSTALL IT

I TRIED EVERYTHING AND I COULD NOT INSTALL IT

## SO IN NEXT BRANCH WE WILL HOPEFULLY INSTALL AND USE SHOPIFY CLI
