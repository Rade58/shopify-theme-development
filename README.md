# FOR LOOPS AND SOME OTHER LIQUID THINGS

**WHEN "STORE MANAGER" (I CALLED IT LIKE THIS), STORE OWNER, ANYONE WHO HAS ACCESS TO THE DASBOARD OF THE STORE, ANYONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO OPERATE DASBOARD, DECIDES TO ADD SOMETHING, SOME INFO, IN INTENTION TO ADD DATA TO THE PART OF THE WEBSITE; WE WANT THAT TO REFLECT ON THE UI OF THE STORE, WE WANT THAT DATA TO BE RENDERED**

**ONE OF THE EXAMPLES FOR THIS IS NAVIGATION**

## GO TO DASBOARD OF YOUR STORE AND IN LEF MENU FOR (Online Store) YOU CAN FIND `Navigation`

YOU CAN SEE **Menus**

I HAVE TWO MENUS: Main (WITH ITEMS Home, Catalog, Contact), AND Footer (WITH ITEMS Search)
