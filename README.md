# USING AND INSTALLING CSS FRAMEWORK

WE CAN USE TAILWIND (I SAW COUPLE TUTORIALS THAT SHOW YOU HOW)

BUT WE ARE GOING TO USE BOOTSTRAP

## WHEN SETTING THIS WE ARE LOOKING INTO `/assets` FOLDER

IT'S A FOLDER FOR EVERYTHING: **FOR CSS, FOR JAVASCRIPT AND FOR IMAGES**

NOW WE ARE INTERESTED IN CSS

## WE WILL DOWNLOAD BOOTSTRAP

**OTHER ALTERNATIVE IS USING CDN** (WE WON'T BE DOING THAT)

[DOWNLOAD IT](https://getbootstrap.com/)

EXTRACTIT

COPY MINIFIED VERSION OF CSS AND JAVASCRIPT AND PUT THEM IN `/assets` FOLDER (TOGETHER WITH MAP FILES)

**I TRIED ADDING FOLDER BUT YOU CAN'T DO THI**

I ADDED THIS INSIDE `assets`

```zsh
bootstrap.min.css  bootstrap.min.css.map  bootstrap.min.js  bootstrap.min.js.map
```

## LINK THIS FILES BY EDITING `layout/theme.liquid`

**FOR THE FIRST TIME WE WILL BE WRITTING LIQUID SPECIFIC SYNTAX**

WE ARE GOING TO USE `asset_url` **FILTER** FOR THE FIRT TIME

IT SHOULD BE SELF EXPLANATORY IF YOU TAKE IN MIND THAT LIQUID IS TEMPLATING LANGUAGE AND THAT WE ARE TEMPLATING; **THERE FOR I WONT BE EXPLAINING IT TOO MUCH SINCE YOU HAVE DOCUMENTATION**

[SEE HERE](https://shopify.dev/api/liquid/filters/url-filters)

WE WILL ALSO USE stylesheet_tag FILTER AND script_tag FILTER (IT IS ALSO APPARENT WHAT THEY MEAN)

IN head SECTION I THREW THIS

- `code layout/theme.liquid`

```liquid
{{ 'bootstrap.min.css' | asset_url | stylesheet_tag }}
  
```

AND I ADDED THIS AT THE END OF body SECTION

```
  {{ 'bootstrap.min.js' | asset_url | script_tag }}
```

# NOW LETS TRY ADDING SOME BOOTSTRAP CLASS ON SOMETHING

I'LL TRY ADDING SOME CLASS HERE: `sections/header.liquid`

I ADDED THE BUTTON AND ADDED IT A CLASS AND IT SEEMS THAT BOOTSTRAP IS WORING

OF COURSE I DID RUN `shopify theme serve` AND ON LOCALHOT I DID SEE CHANGES

# AND DISPAOINTING THING IS THAT SCSS OR SASS I DEPRECATED

SHOPIFY DECIDED TO DO THAT WHICH IS DISPOINTING

## ALSO YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH ADD YOUR OWN JAVASCRIPT, LIKE YOU DID WITH THE BOOTSTRAP ONE
