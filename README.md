# EXTENSIONS FOR SHOPIFY LIQUID

INSTALLED [ONE FOR SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING](https://github.com/panoply/vscode-liquid)

AND INSTALLED [ONE FOR THE SNIPPETS](https://github.com/killalau/vscode-liquid-snippets)

WE WILL TEST THIS NOW BY CREATING AND EDITING NEW SECTION

```
touch sections/2_hero.liquid
```

TRY TYPING SOMETHING LIKE `section` FOR EXAMPLE, YOU WILL GET SUGESTION (IT WONT BE THE FIRST) BUT YOU CAN PICK A SNIPPET TO OUTPUT

SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING ALSO WORKS FOR MARKDOWN

```liquid
{% section 'snippet' %}
```
