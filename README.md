# POPULATE STORE WITH EXAMPLE DATA

YES WE CAN USE SHOPIFY CLI TO DO THAT ALSO

<https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/cli/core-commands#populate>

I WILL TRY POPULATING PRODUCTS, AROUND 20 OF THEM

```
shopify populate products --count 20 
```

GO TO DASBOARD, YOU WILL SE PRODUCTS

PREVIEW YOUR STORE, AND YOU'LL SE DISPALYED PRODUCTS

BUT YOU WONT HAVE ANY NICE IMAGES OR NICE DESCRIPTION AND OTHER METADATA

## BUT YOU COULD DO THAT MANUALLY

THIS IS HOW WOULD STORE OWNER WHO DOESN'T HAVE TERMINAL (SHELL) SKILLS DO THIS

[HERE ARE EXPLAIN CSV FILES](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shopify-admin/productivity-tools/csv-files) (YOU HAVE LINKS IN HERE FOR THE FILES ALSO)

YOU WOULD TAKE ONE FILE AND GO TO `Products` --> `Add Products`, AND YOU WOULD UPLOD FILE

**I ADDED ONE CSV FILE FOR PRODUCTS**
