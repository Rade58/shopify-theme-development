# THEME KITIS THE OLD WAY OF BUILDING THEMES

THERE ARE TWO APPROACHES

BUILDING THEME WITH **THEME KIT AND LIQUID TEMPLATE LANGUAGE**

AND `MODERN WAY` (2021 YEAR) IS BUILDING THEME WITH **SHOPIFY CLI AND JSON TAMPLATES**

**WE NEED TO LEARN BOTH WAYS**

## WE ARE GOING TO LEARN THEME KIT APPROACH BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW HOW TO MAYBE CUSTOMIZE SOME OLDER THEME THAT IS EXISTING FOR THE LONG TIME AND MERCHANT WANTS TO CHANGE SOMETHING

I GUESS THAT WOULD BE PROBABLE SCENARIO
