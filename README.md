# THEME KITIS THE OLD WAY OF BUILDING THEMES

## BEFORE WE START JUST TO TELL YOU THAT YOU CAN SEE CODE OR EDIT CODE DIRECTLY FROM DASBORD OF YOUR THEME BY CLICKING ON `Actions` BUTTON

I CAN SEE BUNCH OF FILES, SOME OF THEM ARE LIQUID, AND SOME OF THEM ARE JSON

## THEME KIT VS SHOPIFY CLI

THERE ARE TWO APPROACHES

BUILDING THEME WITH **THEME KIT AND LIQUID TEMPLATE LANGUAGE**

AND `MODERN WAY` (2021 YEAR) IS BUILDING THEME WITH **SHOPIFY CLI AND JSON TAMPLATES**

**WE NEED TO LEARN BOTH WAYS**

BUT FIRST WE ARE GOING TO LEARN THEME KIT APPROACH

## WE ARE GOING TO LEARN THEME KIT APPROACH BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW HOW TO MAYBE CUSTOMIZE SOME OLDER THEME THAT IS EXISTING FOR THE LONG TIME AND MERCHANT WANTS TO CHANGE SOMETHING

I GUESS THAT WOULD BE PROBABLE SCENARIO
